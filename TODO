= SOONER

- Extract an interface from MemcachedClient and add a factory for setting these
  up.  Configuration is getting a bit gross, so containing these would be good.

- Add a middle layer that allows people to handle their own data and flag
  handling.  Blair Zajac has a use case where each request may need a separate
  transcoder.

= LATER

- Add some reasonably long and configurable absolute limits to prevent node
  failures from hanging forever.

- State indicators
  - getAvailableServers()
  - getUnavailableServers()

- JSON Transcoder
