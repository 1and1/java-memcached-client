<h1>Changelog for SpyMemcached</h1>
<h2>Changes from release 2.4.2 to 2.5</h2>
<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:dVFDCC&amp;chl=Dustin|Matt|Blair|Ahn|Greg|Kristian" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release of 2.5

Changes since the 2.4 series:

The main new feature of the 2.5 release is support for SASL auth
to go along with the same feature in the memcached 1.4.3 and later
servers.

There is also a new feature which can be used in conjunction with the
failure cancel mode to close all connections to memcached servers if
there are timeouts against a server.  This helps to recover from
situations where a memcached server in the list may hard fail.

Also notable is this commit:
cba26c1 If the String value of the socket address starts with a /, remove it.

This does affect Ketama hashing, as it was found there could be some
occasional mismatch with libketama.  A much larger test was added
and to a pretty large degree, compatibility with libketama's hashing is
assured.  Proceed with caution if you'll be running a mixed environment
of 2.5 and pre-2.5 spymemcached clients.  To get the old behavior by
default, a custom interface is easily implemented.

Additionally, there have been a number of bug fixes, comment cleanups
some new tests, and some consistency fixes.

Changes since 2.4.2:

Ahn Seong Hwa (2):
      New TCP connection timeout feature; if server fails completely, d/c.
      fix for useless check statement that is for continuous timeout exception counter

Blair Zajac (3):
      Be more generous in the strings that AddrUtil#getAddresses() will parse.
      Fix AddrUtilTest#testIPv6Host() hostname assertion.
      Fix consistency issue in ConnectionFactoryBuilder.isDaemon()

Dustin Sallings (19):
      Beginnings of SASL support.
      A slightly better model for SASL auth.
      Authentication should allow specification of a mechanism.
      Refactored broadcast to allow for node selection.
      Working multi-step auth.
      Refactored SASL auth for greater reuse.
      Added support for listing SASL mechanisms.
      Reformatted callback handler.
      Don't throw away an exception.
      Use the socket address as the realm.
      Better auth API, handles connection drops.
      Log the bug that causes reconnection on first connect.
      Replaced Long nanos with long millis for op queue block offer timeout.
      Ensure the factory builder can be used to specify enqueue block size.
      Get rid of special constructors for op enqueue timeouts.
      Do blocking inserts from the cache loader test.
      Auth fix for mechanisms that have an initial response.
      If the String value of the socket address starts with a /, remove it.
      A larger libketama extract for compatibility testing.

Greg Kim (1):
      Implementing read-only methods in MemcachedNodeROImpl - issue86

Kristian Eide (1):
      Allow user-specified wait time for availability of queue space.

Matt Ingenthron (14):
      Invert the ConnectionFactoryBuilderTest to go with new logic.
      Document unexpected incr/decr behavior.  Issue 48.
      Various Javadoc completeness.
      Docs for path to FailureModes on DefaultConnectionFactory. Issue 115.
      Clarify Future<Boolean>, issue 63.
      Clarify what is planned after a disconnect.
      Enhance MemcachedNode to know whether auth should happen.
      Changed AuthTest description to match reality.
      Manual test to ensure correct connection handling with SASL.
      Enhanced ConnectionFactoryBuilder test for auth.
      Minor fixes to SASL reconnect test.
      Handle auth failures more gracefully; maximum failures.
      Log operation failures as potential auth failures.
      Actually use the args to SASLConnectReconnect; shutdown nicely.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:3BBBB&amp;chl=Dustin|Joseph|Lewis|Wang|ciaranj" alt="contributors"/><pre>Version 2.4

Changes since the 2.3 series.

Bug Fixes:

* Memcached node tracking.
  When a timeout occurs on an operation, the exception indicates the
  server node that was the intendend recipient of the operation.
* Fixed reconnect loss on multiple simultaneous connection failures.
  This is a rare occurrence, but the wrong thing would happen if two
  simultaneous reconnects were requeued for any reason.
* Fixed a race condition that occurred when tearing down a connection.
  There was a case where shutting down a connection would cause an NPE
  to get logged due to the a race between a selector check and the
  selector being shut down.  Unlikely to affect a running app, but
  it was still wrong.
* Handle initial connect failures.
  There were rare cases where an async connect would error instantly
  on the first attempt, but that connect wouldn't be retried.
* Sequence number wrapping bug.
  If you sent more than 2 billion or so requests to a node, the client
  would find itself in an infinite loop trying to cmoe up with a new
  opaque value.
* Suboptimal back-off algorithm.
  The previous back-off algorithm wouldn't create a reasonable
  reconnect curve.  The new one is more gradual and has a configurable
  maximum ceiling.

Features:

* ConnectionFactoryBuilder
  Rather than having to build a custom subclass of
  DefaultConnectionFactory to override behaviors, you can now use a
  ConnectionFactoryBuilder to easily assemble a ConnectionFactory as
  you want it.
* Mutation-only CAS mutator
  Previously, the CASMutator required an initial object to use if the
  object you were attempting to mutate wasn't found.  Now you can
  specify this as NULL and CASMutator will *only* mutate an existing
  object, but never create a new one.
* CacheLoader
  CacheLoader provides a couple of convenient mechanisms for
  efficiently loading bulk data.  I've seen many benchmarks trying to
  see how fast data can go into memcached through the client (as
  opposed to normal usage), but they do things to make it
  unnecessarily slow.  This should satisfy both benchmarking
  requirements and legitimate bulk loading requirements.
* KetamaNodeLocator is more configurable.
  The node data ketama uses for building a hash is configurable now in
  an effort to make consistent hashing work between java and C#.

Performance Enhancements:

* Disable Nagle Algorithm by Default
  The usage of the Nagle algorithm (tcpNoDelay) is now configurable
  and is configured off by default (Nagle algorithm off = tcpNoDelay
  on).  This should be more optimal for most configurations.
* Multi-set Escalation in the Binary Protocol
  With no changes to the API, multiple sequential sets will be
  escalated into a multi-set operation similar to multi-get.  In a
  bulk load test, this is generally around 2x faster.
* Asynchronous Transcoding Service
  A transcoder can request a transcoder service (effectively a
  threadpool) to asynchronously decode cache response objects both
  outside of the API and outside of the caller thread.

<div><img class="pie" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p&amp;chs=400x300&amp;chd=s:9&amp;chl=Dustin" alt="contributors"/><pre>Release 2.3.1

Changes since 2.3:

* Fixed connection observeration.
  There was a condition where an exception could occur that wouldn't
  be tracked properly.  There's no automated test for this, but a test
  was constructed to manually verify the behavior with different
  server failure conditions.

* Fixed stat parsing for some stats.
  Tests were added to confirm that both stat responses that don't
  begin with STAT and stat values that contain spaces are handled
  correctly.

* Honor transcoder sizes.
  This adds a new requirement on the transcoder API to specify how
  many bytes the transcoder can store or read.  This both allows small
  transcoders to put size constraints in that will immediately throw
  an IllegalArgumentException when a result is too large to possibly
  work as well as allowing users to customize their memcached
  instances to allow for larger than normal objects.

Changes since 2.2:

* A Map interface to memcached
    This is somewhat limited, of course, in that you obviously can't
    list all of the mappings, but you can replace many Map<String,V>
    usages with a memcached backed map.

* Failure Modes
    There are now three failure modes to choose from so you can decide
    what you want to do in the case of a node failure. (see
    FailureMode in the documentation for more details).

* Connection Observation
    You can register for callbacks that will notify you when a node
    goes up or down.  This is useful for things like notifying
    monitoring systems, or preventing a system from starting up until
    a required minimum number of memcached servers come online.

* Misc bug fixes and accessibility to memcached functionality.

* Data decoding occurs in caller threads instead of IO thread.
  This should greatly improve performance by spreading out the load to
  more threads. (Kristian Eide)
* MemcachedClientIF is added as an interface the client represents.
  This allows a client making use of the interface to mock the memcached
  interaction for better test coverage (Nelz)
* Binary protocol stat support (protocol wasn't complete until October 19).
* Async incr/decr with no default (Nick Brachet)

The initial reason for it to exist was protocol abstraction (specifically to
implement the binary protocol).  The slowness of the binary protocol release
has kept this dangling for quite a while.

Although there still isn't a released binary server, I want to get this release
out because there are a lot of other good things that have happened since:

 * CAS
 * Hash implementations and tests
 * node location algorithms (e.g. ketama consistent hashing)
 * Lots of fixes.

There are still things to do, but much of what people have been asking for can
be found within. this release and all of the bugs that have been reported
to-date have been fixed.
